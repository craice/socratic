# Socratic Product Discovery — Quick Reference

## The 6-Step Quickstart Loop

1. **Detect context:** mode (Exploring / Framing / Executing) + risk (Low / Medium / High)
2. **Name the decision:** A vs B vs C, by when, what "do nothing" means
3. **Separate reality:** Facts (with source) vs Inferences vs Assumptions vs Unknowns
4. **Pick one kill assumption:** the one that kills the plan if false
5. **Turn it into a test:** 1 hypothesis → 1 cheapest experiment → 1 metric window → 1 threshold
6. **Close the loop:** recap + next step + decision rule (proceed / pivot / stop) + confidence

## Risk Calibration Table

| Risk | Examples | Rigor |
|--------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Low    | copy change, small UI tweak          | 1-2 questions → 1 test → quick threshold               |
| Medium | new feature, workflow change          | 2-3 questions → 1-2 hypotheses → 1-2 tests             |
| High   | pricing, ICP change, platform bet    | triangulate + pre-mortem + stop rules                   |

## FIAU Framework

- **Fact:** verified, with source
- **Inference:** conclusion drawn from facts, not yet validated
- **Assumption:** belief without evidence
- **Unknown:** missing information to collect

---

## Hypothesis Template

> "If **(change)**, then **(measurable outcome)** for **(segment)** within **(time window)**, because **(mechanism)**."

---

## Decision Rule Template

- **Proceed** if...
- **Pivot** if...
- **Stop** if...

---

## Confidence Scale (1-5)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Almost no evidence; mostly guessing              |
| 2     | Weak signals; critical unknowns remain           |
| 3     | Some evidence, but key assumptions untested      |
| 4     | Strong evidence on most items; minor gaps        |
| 5     | Triangulated evidence; assumptions tested        |

## Threshold Templates

- **Conversion/volume:** "Proceed if ≥ N qualified signups in T days; stop if < M."
- **Behavioral:** "Proceed if ≥ X% complete step Y without help within T."
- **Lift vs baseline:** "Proceed if +X% vs baseline on metric K over T."
- **Retention:** "Proceed if D7 ≥ X% for cohort C over T."
- **Qual signal:** "Proceed if ≥ N users describe as must-have within T days."

## 3 Bias-Check Questions

1. "What would we expect to observe if this were false?"
2. "Is this the best idea, or the first idea?"
3. "What evidence would change our mind?"
